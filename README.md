Project #2 CS-210
For this specific project we were tasked with creating program that would allow inestors to track their progression over time,
we also had a list of functionability features that airgead would like incorporated into the program. I felt that when working 
in project #2 i organized vry well compared to project #1, i also felt that i labeled my in line commentz particularly well,
especially since i was not used to doing that before this course. in some caases i notice now that i can clean up my code by
shortening my line comments as well as possibly shortening my code with more efficient commands and prompts. The ending of this
project was one of the hardest ive had just because i kept confusing myself, however after some youtube videos and looking at
past projects i was able to figure out how to end my program correctly. The skils i got with vusial studio on this porject
alone, was an enormous help on other projects and assighnments in this class, i actually was awful before this class with that
software so im really glad that now i can navigate it correctly. i went over the project multiple times adding and delting
longer or short in line comments as well as finding ways to shorten my code as to beef down how much was taking u the screen as i feel a healthy balance is not having too much code as it can confuse you bu tht also goes the saem way for too little code or too simplified becasue that can confuse me as well if im trying to make changes.
