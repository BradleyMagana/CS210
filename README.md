Project #2 CS-210
For this specific project, we were tasked with creating a program that would allow investors to track their progression over time; we also had a list of functionality features
that airhead would incorporate into the program. I felt that when working on project #2 i organized very well compared to project #1, i also thought that i labeled my inline
comments particularly well, primarily since i was not used to doing that before this course. In some cases, i notice now that i can clean up my code by shortening my line comments
and possibly shortening my code with more efficient commands and prompts. The ending of thisproject was one of the hardest I've had just because i kept confusing myself, however
after some youtube videos and looking at past projects, i was able to figure out how to end my program correctly. The skills i got with visual studio on this project
alone, was an enormous help on other projects and assignments in this class, i was awful before this class with that software, so I'm delighted that now i can navigate it
correctly. i went over the project multiple times, adding and deleting longer or short inline comments as well as finding ways to shorten my code as to beef down how much was
taking up the screen as i feel a healthy balance is not having too much code as it can confuse you bu that also goes the same way for too little code or too simplified because
that can confuse me as well if I'm trying to make changes.
